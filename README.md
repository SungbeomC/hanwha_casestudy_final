and its results in a csv file.

sungbeom_choi_casestudy_Q3 includes an answer for the question #3 of the case study. This folder includes codes for price momentum score for periods of 126 and 
63 days and their results in csv files. It also contains codes for exponential moving average (EMA) for a period of 20 days and its results in a csvfile. To compare 
price momentum scores with different periods as well as exponential moving average, there are two files named Explanation_with_graphs.py and Explanation_with_graphs.md.
Under these two files, I took Amazon as a sample stock and depicted plot and bar graphs of different scoring periods and exponential moving average. The md file
visualizes how graphs are distinct with each other and elaborates on whether they properly reflect price trends or not.
