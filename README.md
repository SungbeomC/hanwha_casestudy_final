# Price Momentum Score

Using stock price data of 10 U.S firms for the past 10 years, I programmed in Python and created codes to (1) get price momentum scores corresponding to closing prices of past days by using linear interpolation; (2) get exponential moving average with different periods of days (252, 126, and 63 days); (3) present bar graphs of both price momentum scores and exponential moving average to visualize and compare which approach can reflect and respond to price changes more sensitively.

sungbeom_choi_casestudy_Q2 includes codes for price momentum score for a period of 252 days and its results in a csv file. sungbeom_choi_casestudy_Q3 includes codes for price momentum score for periods of 126 and 63 days and their results in csv files. It also contains codes for exponential moving average (EMA) for a period of 20 days as well as its results in a csvfile. 

Under the sungbeom_choi_casestudy_Q3 directory, there are two files named Explanation_with_graphs.py and Explanation_with_graphs.md. In the Explanation_with_graphs.py file, to compare price momentum scores with different periods and exponential moving average, I took Amazon as a sample stock and depicted plot and bar graphs of different scoring periods and exponential moving average. The md file
visualizes how graphs are distinct with each other and elaborates on whether they properly reflect price trends or not.
