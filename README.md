# Momentum Score vs Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in Stock Market

I took Amazon as a sample stock to visualize and compare momentum scores with different periods and the exponential moving average.

The first plot indicates the closing price of Amazon stock; the second, third, and fourth bar graph indicates the price momentum score with periods of 252, 126, and 63 days, respectively; the last bar graph indicates exponential moving average with a period of 20 days.

Looking at the three bar graphs of price momentum score, we can see how they are corresponding to price changes over time. When the closing price is about to decline, the bar graphs tend to present relatively lower and decreasing momentum scores. On the other hand, when the closing price is in an increasing trend, momentum scores are relatively high, denoting an increasing rate of price change. The difference between the bar graphs of momentum scores is that the fourth graph with a period of 63 days seems to respond to price fluctuations more sensitively than the rest of the graphs. Put differently, traders who aim for short-term investments can choose a period of 63 days to analyze the momentum score, while those interested in long-term investments can use a period of 252 days.

For the last bar graph, I wanted to see if the exponential moving average can capture price trends more accurately. Since the exponential moving average tends to place more weight on recent data, I expected its graph to be more dynamic than momentum score graphs. As opposed to my expectation, however, bar graphs of momentum scores are more intuitive and able to reflect subtle changes in stock price. Yet, considering the exponential characteristics of the exponential moving average, it will be still beneficial for short-term investors and can be referenced anytime.
