Price Momentum Score vs Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

I took Amazon as a sample stock to visualize and compare momentum scores with different periods and the exponential moving average.

The first plot indicates the closing price of Amazon stock; the second, third, and fourth bar graph demonstrates the price momentum score 
with a period of 252, 126, and 63 days, respectively; the last bar graph displays the exponential moving average with a period of 20 days.

Looking at the three bar graphs of the price momentum score with different time periods, we can note how they are corresponding to price changes over time. 
When the closing price is about to decline, the graphs tend to present relatively lower and decreasing momentum scores. On the other hand, 
when the closing price is in an increasing trend, momentum scores are relatively high, denoting an increasing rate of price change. The difference among these graphs of the momentum score 
with different periods is that the fourth graph with a period of 63 days seems to respond to price fluctuations more sensitively than the rest of the graphs. 
Put differently, traders who aim for short-term investments can choose a period of 63 days to analyze the momentum score, while those interested in long-term investments can use a period of 252 days.

For the last bar graph, I tried to examine if the exponential moving average can capture price trends more accurately. Since the exponential moving average places
more weight on recent data, I assumed its graph to be more dynamic than the momentum score graphs. As opposed to my expectation, however, the graphs of the momentum score 
are more intuitively responsive and able to reflect subtle variations in stock price. Yet, given the characteristics of the exponential moving average as well as the exponential function, 
it will be still beneficial for short-term investors and can be referenced whenever screening the price tendency.
